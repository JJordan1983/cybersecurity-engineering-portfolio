# Cybersecurity Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases redacted, real-world **security engineering playbooks** and **compliance workflows** from DoD-style environments. 
It highlights two cornerstone capabilities:
- **Endpoint Migration:** CrowdStrike Falcon → Microsoft Defender for Endpoint/Identity/Office
- **Vulnerability Management:** ACAS-driven scanning cadence and POA&M tracking

> **Note:** All materials are generalized; no customer data, networks, or proprietary details are included. These documents demonstrate methodology and leadership only.
